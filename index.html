        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>For the past couple of years I have been working as an EFL teacher, both in face and online, my role taking me from Italy all the way to Australia. I am currently working with the Manchester Codes bootcamp to give myself a solid foundation to build upon and in the future work professionally in a related role.</p>
        <p>I've been passionate about computing since I was young, having experimented with programs and languages many times in my younger years, as well as graduating in Software Engineering in 2010.</p>
